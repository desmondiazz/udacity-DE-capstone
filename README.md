# Udacity DE capstone project

The scope of this project is to understand , what types of crops are produced all over the world , and try to match the temperature patterns in that paricular country. There will be mainly two datasets used in this project
- World crop production (https://data.world/agriculture/crop-production)
- World Temperature Data (https://www.kaggle.com/berkeleyearth/climate-change-earth-surface-temperature-data)

# About datasets 
    - Both the datasets are of type csv.
    - World crop production data includes crop production all over the world, from 1961 to 2014. This Includes crop statistics for 173 products in Africa, the Americas, Asia, Europe, and Oceania
    - World Temperature Data includes temperature data from 1743 - 2013.The world temperature dataset has multiple datasets under it , for the purpose of this project i will be using GlobalLandTemperaturesByCountry.csv dataset.

# Steps to execute the project!
